1. MOVIE GENRECLASSIFICATION
Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of amovie based on its plot summary or other textual information. Youcan use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifierssuch as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support VectorMachines.
2.Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam orlegitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings withclassifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support VectorMachines to identify spam messages
  3.CUSTOMER CHURNPREDICTION
Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. Use historical customer data, includingfeatures like usage behavior and customer demographics, and tryalgorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or GradientBoosting to predict churn.
